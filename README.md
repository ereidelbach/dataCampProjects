# Project Description

Recently [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) started creating a new line of educational products as part of their growing catalogue of Data Science courses. In their words, proejcts "give you hands-on experience solving real-world problems." These courses are designed by DataCamp's team of expert instructors and "are an important step in [one's] journey to become data fluent and help [one] build [their] data science portfolio."

My personal goal will be to document my journey through these projects by posting completed notebooks as I finish them, practing old skills and acquiring new ones along the way. If you happen to stumble upon my piece of cyberspace, I hope you enjoy this adventure as much as I will!
